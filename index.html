    <h1>15-Year-Old Homeless Boy Caring for His Cancer-Stricken Parents Needs Your Help</h1>

    <p>Dear brothers and sisters,<br>
    Dear mothers and fathers,<br>
    Dear compassionate souls across the world,</p>

    <p>If you are reading this, I humbly ask you — please, don’t scroll past this message if there’s any way you can help. I believe with all my heart that your kindness can change our lives forever, and I know God sees and rewards every act of love.</p>

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Yohani</strong>, a 15-year-old boy from Rwanda. I am the oldest of three children. I’m just a teenager, but I carry responsibilities far beyond my years. Today, I write to you with a heart full of pain, but also with hope — that maybe someone out there will hear our cry and help us survive.</p>

    <h2>My Family Is Falling Apart</h2>
    <p>Both of my parents — <strong>Jessica</strong> and <strong>Francisco</strong> — are suffering from cancer. Their illnesses have taken everything from us. All of our savings are gone, all borrowed money used up, and we’ve now lost our home. The bank took it away because we could no longer afford to pay back the debts caused by hospital bills.</p>

    <p>We are now homeless, sleeping wherever we can. Some nights we sleep hungry. Other nights we sleep on the floor, sick and cold.</p>

    <h2>My Siblings Were Expelled from School</h2>
    <p>Because we can no longer afford tuition, my younger siblings were forced to drop out of school. They don’t understand why their world collapsed. I try to comfort them, but inside, I’m also lost. I’ve become their caretaker, and the burden is heavy.</p>

    <h2>I’m Only 15, but I Have to Be the Parent</h2>
    <p>I clean, I cook, I look after my sick parents, and I try to give hope to my younger siblings. I do all this while still being a child myself. There are days when I feel like I’m drowning, and today, I’m reaching out to the world for help — with humility and tears.</p>

    <h2>What I’m Asking For</h2>
    <p>I am asking for your help to raise <strong>$3,000</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide medical care for my parents</li>
      <li>Buy food and basic survival needs for our family</li>
      <li>Help my siblings return to school</li>
      <li>Find shelter and a safer place to live</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>May God Bless You</h2>
    <p>To anyone who chooses to help — from the deepest part of my heart, thank you. May God bless you richly for your generosity. One day, I hope I’ll be in a position to give back and help someone else, just as you’re helping us today.</p>

    <p><em>With love and hope,<br>Yohani<br>Age 15<br>Homeless, but not hopeless</em></p>
